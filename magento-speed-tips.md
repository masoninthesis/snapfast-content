# 3 Shortcuts to Speeding Up Your Magento Store:

**The bottom line is thisâ€“** 

There is no magic bullet for speeding up Magento. Each and every website is build differently with different types of products, themes, extensions, users and traffic levels. The competition is fierce and studies show your customers won't wait more than 2 seconds for your website to load. 

*The only way to beat the competition and satisfy your customers is to have a team of Magento experts in your corner. Let us keep Magento firing on all cylinders while you focus on your business.*

There are many considerations to make sure Magento runs quickly, but **_here are just a few things to make sure you're doing right:_**

1. **Use Redis as the cache-backend:** 
  * Saving the default Magento caches in Redis can provide a significant boost in site speed as well as improve the amount of traffic your server can handle! 
  * Redis is a storage program that stores information in the server's memory. By saving files in memory it makes easier and faster for the server to retrieve and read those files. This not only will speed up your site (and admin area) but also reduces the load on the server enabling it to handle greater levels of traffic. Redis is free software and by default Magento can save cache files and session files in Redis. When setup and properly configured with Magento Redis can provide a great boost in speed.
2. **Use an opcode cache like Xcache, APC etc:**
  * PHP processing time is often the biggest bottleneck with Magento. A well configured opcode cache can help reduce processing time for Magento php files.
  * Each time a page on your Magento site is loaded many different PHP files are run. An opcode cache works with PHP to cache those popular files in a way that's faster for the server to process. This can make as much as a 60% difference in speed.
3. **Reduce the number of requests:**
  * Combine css / js, use sprites, embed image icons as base64, or use lazyloading for images. All these tricks as well as others can cut the number of requests by 50% or more drastically improving load times.
  * Use the free tool www.webpagetest.org to test your website and note the number of total requests. For a visitor to load your website their browser has to process and download all those items. By combining items or deferring them from loading (lazy loading, async processing, etc.) you can drastically reduce the number of items needed to show a webpage.
